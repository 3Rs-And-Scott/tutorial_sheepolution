# tutorial_sheepolution

This is the result of following a [love2d tutorial](http://sheepolution.com/learn/book/contents). You can spawn circles and rectangles that will move to the right. The rectangles will appear filled when they are colliding with the sheep. This was used as a learning example for myself.

Controls
--------

- `r` - spawn rectangle
- `c` - spawn circle

Installation
-------
